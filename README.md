Architecture:
- Express.js for the web application framework
- MongoDB as database
- Mongoose as the ODM layer
- Authentication and Authorization: JSON Web Tokens for each user
- Hashing: bcryptjs
- Jest and Supertest: Unit Test

 -> Overall, the solution follows common best practices for building a Node.js API with Express, MongoDB, and JWT-based authentication. The modularity and testing approach help maintain code quality and maintainability.
